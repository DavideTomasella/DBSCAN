# DBSCAN
Matlab (re)implementation of DBSCAN ('Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise') with both a standard and new approach. The standard algorithm is implemented with kd-tree and concatenate map. The original algorithm is an parallel solution that pre-calculates the distance matrix and solves the cluster expansion for multiple node at the same time.

The repository also contains a comparison for some test cases between the developed solutions and the Matlab implementation of k-means and DBSCAN.
